# SimpleBadMovement
Just a little movement system I made. You can look at things, walk, run, jump, crouch, slide, and climb objects. The controls are WASD or arrow keys, shift to run, space to jump,
and control to crouch or slide if running. If an object without the NonClimbable tag is in front of you you can climb by pressing space. Just create a capsule, add this script,
a collider, and rigidbody and make the camera a child. Assign the camera as the cam gameobject. That should work
