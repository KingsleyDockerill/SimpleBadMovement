# SimpleBadMovement
Just a little movement system I made. You can look at things, walk, run, jump, crouch, and slide. The controls are WASD or arrow keys, shift to run, space to jump,
and control to crouch or slide if running. Just create a capsule, add this script,a collider, and rigidbody and make the camera a child. Assign the camera as the cam gameobject. That should work
Also, I thought you can climb but apparently after testing you can't
